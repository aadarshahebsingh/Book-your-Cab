Certainly! Here's a more polished version of the README file for your Cab Service System:

# Cab Service System

This C++ program simulates a cab service system within a city, enabling users to find the nearest available cab, update cab locations (an admin-only activity), and view available cabs in a certain area.

## Features

### 1. Find a Cab (Option 1):

Users can input their location index to find the nearest available cab. Utilizes Dijkstra's algorithm to compute the shortest distances from the user's location to all other cab locations. Displays the index and distance of the nearest cab.

### 2. Update Cab Location (Option 2):

Admins can authenticate using a password to access this feature. Allows admins to update an existing cab's location or insert a new cab's location into the system. Provides feedback on the success or failure of the location update.

### 3. View Available Cabs (Option 3):

Users can input their location index to view available cabs near that location. Utilizes the shortest distances computed by Dijkstra's algorithm to determine available cabs. Displays the indices and distances of all available cabs in the specified area.

## How to Use

### Compilation

Compile the program using a C++ compiler, e.g., g++.

### Options

Upon running, the program will display a menu with options. Choose an option by entering the corresponding number. Follow the prompts for further actions (e.g., entering a location index).

### Exiting

To exit the program, select option 4 from the menu.

## Dependencies

The program requires a C++ compiler to compile and run.
